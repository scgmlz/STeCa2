ver. 2.0.5, released 2017.12.01
-------------------------------

New features:

* an option to switch between averaging and summing intensities in histograms
* simple zooming in the histogram graph

Improvements:

* some code cleanup
* Better sorting of the table of pole figure points.
* Table of pole figure points does not auto-select the alpha & beta comumns
* "open files" dialog caches the file type information
* read new STRESS-SPEC metadata
* all file dialogs are now uniformly looking

Bug fixes:

* Correctly enabled fallback to idw if pole figure point interpolation
  by averaging fails

ver. 2.0.4, released 2016.12.01
-------------------------------

New features:

* image overlay: visualise gamma slices and 2theta bins;
  show where gamma=0 is
* the "about" dialog indicates if the build is 64-bit;
  startup options reset after a new version is installed
  (to alert the user to that fact)

Improvements:

* raw diffractogram (before background adjustment) is plotted as dots
  (to show the nature of the histogram binning)
* detector geometry defaults to 1035 / 1 mm
* image color scale adjusted to show lower counts more clearly
* add/remove file buttons moved above the file list

Bug fixes:

* more conservative memory allocation that, we hope, fixes the strange
  "bad allocation" errors on some machines
* utf8 (Greek) characters replaced by ASCII strings (e.g. "gamma")
  in output text files

ver. 2.0.3a (hotfix), released 2016.11.14
-----------------------------------------

Changes:

* fixed incorrect calculation of bin numbers for combined datasets
* non-used configuration entries (detector) temporarily hidden

ver. 2.0.3 (Armistice), released 2016.11.11
-------------------------------------------

New features:

* check updates; optionally at startup
* loads TIFF data format
* loads Mar data format
* handles beam offset
* option to disable gamma-slicing
* option to disable neutron count averaging (experimental)

Improvements:

* optimized angle map calculation
* improved image display resizing
* image overlay shows beam centre crosshairs
* Metadata view is a table view
* more compact gui layout
* X button that clears reflections
* progress bar shows the progress of pole figure points interpolation
* gamma slicing shown in images

Bug fixes:

* #28 - a bug in vanadium correction

ver. 2.0.2a (hotfix), released 2016.08.29
-----------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

* vanadium correction re-enabled for diffractograms
* fixed labels in diffractogram output

ver. 2.0.2, released 2016.08.23
-------------------------------

New features:

* #23 - normalisation to monitor count

Bug fixes:

* #22 - missing values in saved diagrams
* Diagrams of RAW reflection values are output without (meaningless) error limits.
* "all datasets" curve works

Changes, improvements:

* The range of gammas is now retrieved at the 'middle' 2 theta.
* Output text files are written with OS-specific end-of-line (\r\n on Windows).
* Output text formats: only .dat (spaces) and .csv (commas); .txt is discontinued.
* Output dialogs: improved gamma slicing controls.

ver. 2.0.1, released 2016.06.29
-------------------------------

New features:

* Datasets with different 2theta and/or gamma values (i.e. angle maps) are now properly combined.
* Some relevant warnings are now shown on the statusbar.

Bug fixes:

* #1442 - crash when normalizing to invalid monitor counts or delta time
* #1443 - NaN errors shown by the diffractogram plot

Changes in code:

* statubar-messaging
* semi-major code refactoring, rearranged modules and source code files
* new specialized types and typedefs to improve type safety and self-documentation of code
* cache classe to handle angle maps
* Fixed bugs #1442, #1443, and a number of small things

STeCa2-2.0.0.1, released 2016.06.09
-----------------------------------
* First release for user acceptance testing
